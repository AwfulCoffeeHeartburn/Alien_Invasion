So far so good. I am enjoying myself. Today I learned a little bit about how to use the pygame API. Many of the oncepts I've 
gone over I've encountered before. I also learned how to set the game window size, its color, how to import an image in the 
game and position that image and a little bit about the concepts underlying game design with pycharm. For example, everything 
in pygame is conceived of as a rectangle, or rect, because rectangles are simple geometric shapes, so they are easy to work 
with. Also, everything in the game has a "surface", which must be consistently re-loaded/re-drawn, giving the game and the 
objects in it the illusion of movement. Finally, each time the user interacts with the game it is an "event", and each event
must be retrieved with the .get() method, which we place within a for loop, within a while loop, to keep things running 
smoothly. That's all for today.

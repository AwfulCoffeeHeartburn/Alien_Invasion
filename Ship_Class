        # Unless it's not called in this class, but instead is called in the main game file...? Let's have a look.
        # It's not called in the main game file but... maybe just by initializing this attribute we position the
        # ship at mid bottom, maybe it isn't necessary to call it. I think that must be it. Yeah.
